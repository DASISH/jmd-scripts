### #run the following commands on the terminal to do the CKAN postgres optimisation
####


## Step 1: login into ckan postgres database, which is called ckan_default (maybe different if you have given it a different name when you created it
sudo -u postgres psql ckan_default
# this will ask you for password, you give it the password


## Step 2: once you are inside ckan_default database, type the following sql scripts one by one.

\i /home/work/ckan_db_optimization_scripts/constraints.sql; 
\i /home/work/ckan_db_optimization_scripts/what_to_alter.sql; 
\i /home/work/ckan_db_optimization_scripts/add_eric_indexes.sql; 


## Step 3: quit from the database (after you have run the above three scripts, type ‘\q’ to quit)
\q
# that is it, the optimisation is done
